## Thesis: 
Heating and electricity are the largest sources of CO₂ emissions in most regions, underscoring their significant role in global pollution and a need for policy.

## Context: 
Who: Students, researchers, policymakers, and the general public.

What: Climate change is a pressing challenge that requires immediate action. Awareness is the first step toward meaningful change, and understanding how our societal habits contribute to CO₂ emissions is essential. This dash offers valuable insights for policymakers to identify key areas for action while also empowering individuals to recognize and reduce their own environmental impact.

How: A slideshow and visual/interactive dash. The dash is made up of three graphs:

1. Choropleth map of the world illustrating different levels of CO₂ emissions.
2. Line graph illustrating a specific country's emissions over time.
3. Bar chart of various sectors that make up a country's pollution level.

## Data Used:
CSV file containing annual CO₂ emissions by region (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/annual-co-emissions-by-region?time=earliest..2023). CSV file containing annual CO₂ emissions by sector and region (https://ourworldindata.org/grapher/co-emissions-by-sector). Located in the root directory titled 'annual-co-emissions-by-region.csv' and 'co-emissions-by-sector.csv'.

## Strategies from SwD:
Using a bar chart to represent the data because there is less of a learning curve for the audience. (pg 50)

Just-right bar width for bar graph. (pg 53)

Minimal text on slides to reduce clutter. (pg 73)

Color saturation in heat map. (pg 42)

No chart border or data markers, with clean axes and consistent color. (pgs 91-97)

Consistent x- and y-axes. (pg 46)
